# Description

In this task, I connected a setup to lower the voltage from the board's 3V to a safe level for the ADC pin, ensuring it didnâ€™t exceed 3.3V. I adjusted the ADC settings so it could correctly read the voltage within the range I needed. I made the ADC check the voltage every 100ms, then averaged these values over one second to get a stable reading. I showed this average voltage on a display and also sent it to the computer screen.
