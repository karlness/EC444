# Description 
The optical encoder detects the color changes on the wheel's surface from white to black, which shows how the wheel is spinning. As the wheel rotates and switches colors, the encoder creates electrical signals, or pulses, every time it goes from one color to the next. The ESP32 reads these changes in voltage from the pulses to determine the wheel's rotation speed. By counting how many times these pulses occur, the program calculates and displays how fast the wheel is turning.
